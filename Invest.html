      This segment will be quite short because the concept is simple. Download
      an investing app like Robinhood, Nerdwallet, or Webull. Then check the
      stock market to see who is succeeding. Those are the shares you want to
      buy. Companies such as Apple, and Amazon are usually gaining shares, so
      invest $200-$500 into one if not both of them. You could either make back
      less than you gave, or a whole bunch more, depending on how much money the
      company is recieving.

      Some would say this is just a different, safer version of gambling,
      because even if the stock is going down, you recieve something back. That
      is the silver lining in stock investing.
