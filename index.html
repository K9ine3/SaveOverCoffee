    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>
      Hello, my name is King Coffee. As a Black individual from a lower socioeconomic
background, I understand the critical importance of financial literacy and the
need to educate other Black individuals on how to effectively save and manage
their earnings. In todayâ€™s digital age, computers serve as essential tools for
accessing invaluable resources and information that can empower individuals to
achieve their financial goals. This recognition is integral to the development
of this course. As a student, I participated in the Hidden Genius Project, a
computer science program dedicated to enhancing coding knowledge and fostering
entrepreneurial skills. It was through this transformative experience that the
idea for this business was born. My goal is to guide you towards becoming the
best version of yourself financially by navigating through a comprehensive
series of strategies and steps designed to elevate your financial status
exponentially. I am grateful for your participation in this course. My
entrepreneurial journey has been instrumental in helping me secure my own
financial stability, and I am confident that the insights and knowledge shared
here will provide you with a financial cushion and the confidence to live a more
secure and prosperous life. Thank you for joining us, and I look forward to
supporting you on this path to financial empowerment.
