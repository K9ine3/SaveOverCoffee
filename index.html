    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>
      Hi, my name is King Coffee. As a Black person of lower class, I feel that
      it is important to teach other Black people how to save their earnings. A
      computer is so important because it holds sources such as these to help
      others achieve their very needs, and this is very important towards the
      development of this course. As a student I applied for the Hidden Genius
      Project, a computer science program that develops your coding knowledge
      and also leads you towards entrepreneurship. The program is where this
      business sprouted from, and is where you will hopefully become your best
      you financially. You will go through a discourse of ways or perhaps steps
      to achieve an exponential financial status. Thank you for tuning into this
      course, for my entrepreneurship will help me maintain my own life. I pray
      that this course will help you live your life with some coushion
