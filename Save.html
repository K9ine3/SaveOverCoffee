      As a community, Black people have not had the best habits in terms of
      money. Although the system alters our financial success, our rate of
      homelessness is a result of this. We tend to spend money on addictions
      such as alcohol, drugs, and tobacco. Quitting these addictions not only
      account for your mental and physical health, it will save you money. So
      let's figure out how we can progress towards the purge.

      All though it can be difficult to stop an addiction, sometimes you have to
      step out of your comfort zone. Throw out things such as cigarettes and
      beers to get started. When going to stores, simply don't pick them up.
      This is simple for saving. Drugs also come at a large price, so putting
      them behind you would save you some life. Video game currencies also drain
      your bank account. if you spend too much in one time these currencies such
      as V-Bucks, and VC from Fortnite and NBA 2K are often purchased for
      outfits and skills, however, the clothing give you no advantage, therefore
      there is no need to buy the currency.
