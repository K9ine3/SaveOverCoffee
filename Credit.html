      Credit is as it sounds. It is the credit you recieve for something you
      would refer to as integrity with your money. With good credit, there
      things you could by that you couldn't with bad credit: housing, cars, etc.
      require good credit to be bought.

    <h3>Ways to Maintain Good Credit:</h3>
    <p>
      Paying your bills on time is crucialy important. As I said credit is
      summed up to financial integrity. Will you, or will you not be
      responsible. There are also other ways to save your credit such as keeping
      old credit cards opened. And make sure you keep your cards active. Black
      people have often been seen stealing, and scamming for their money.
      Getting caught in the act could also completely plumit your credit. So
      stay away from crime.
